# muxbox

Monorepo for all muxbox. The goal of this project is to build a reliable wifi to multi-sim bonding device for livestream video that runs on a single-board computer such as a Raspberry Pi. This allows RTMP-based livestreaming cameras, such as the GoPro, to stream more reliably under unstable network conditions.

This is being developed by https://twitch.tv/muxfd
